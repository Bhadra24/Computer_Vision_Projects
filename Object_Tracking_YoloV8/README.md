# 🚀 Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my **Computer Vision Projects** repository! This space showcases projects where I apply deep learning, image processing, and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

✅ **Object Detection & Recognition** – Implementing YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and more  
✅ **Image Classification** – CNN-based models for various classification tasks  
✅ **Image Segmentation** – U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and advanced segmentation techniques  
✅ **Pose Estimation & Action Recognition** – Analyzing human motion in images/videos  
✅ **Generative Models** – Exploring GANs and Stable Diffusion for image synthesis  

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project contains:
- 📁 **Code** – Well-structured and documented source code
- 📊 **Datasets** – Links to publicly available datasets (if applicable)
- 📄 **Notebooks** – Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization
- 📜 **Results** – Sample outputs and performance metrics
